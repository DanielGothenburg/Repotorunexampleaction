# Repotorunexampleaction
This repo is used to run the example action created within another repo called ello-world-docker-action. The action in that repo is called HelloWorldAll.
This is why the file named main in this repo has a reference to ello-world-docker-action/HelloWorldAll
The reference is made by using keyword "uses" followed by the repo hosting the action and the name of the action.
